The flask API is being served on port 5000 and can be modified through the docker-compose file 

* ABOUT 
  - I've setup the Flask API to read and write to the backend MongoDB, metrics are collected using the prometheus_client and can be accessible by localhost:5000/metrics

* CONFIGURE
  - Modify the port mapping in the docker-compose.yml file. 
      - Default : 
        - FLASK API : 5000
        - Prometheus : 9090 
  -  In the parent directory  `docker-compose build`, to build the flask app image
  -  To start the stack ` docker-compose up -d `
